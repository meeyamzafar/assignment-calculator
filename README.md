Maryam's Simple Calculator
===================================

Thank you for giving me the oppurtunity to work on this assignment! I throughly enjoyed working on this, and as simple as a calculator sounds to build, I wanted to use some of the frameworks I am comforatble working with, but at the same time to not over-complicate the build.

## Frameworks used:
* Bootstrap Version 4 to make the calculator responsive using the grid system, and many utility functions provided to vertically center the calcultor and adjust on smaller screen sizes
* SCSS - I have compiled the SCSS using [Koala](http://koala-app.com/) which is a SASS compiler and converts it into .css or .min.css files. For this project I have not minified the .css file so that it is possible to go through the CSS and see what I have done.
* Custom CSS - some gradient applications to show modern CSS applications
* jQuery - the jQuery is available in the folder js under script.js. It is very simple, and not minified for readbility.
* Some vanilla JavaScript - There are many different solutions to create the methods for the calculations, however the most powerful of them is the javascript "eval" function - it will take a string and evaluate it accordingly. Any mathematical expression will be avauated accordingly. We have restricted the input values to be numbers only, hence there will be no alphabets to be entered, and the eval function will always evaluate numerals.
